- in the main, collect a max size of z (msize[2])
- color diff total / (msize[2] * zscale * 1000) = color increment (per z increase by 1)
- z0 = z from the map * zsacle * 1000;
- z1 = z from the map * zscale * 1000;
- z point of higher value - z point of lower value = z diff
- z diff * color inc = color_max between those 2 points
- color_max - color = color_diff

simple
- color_diff / x_diff = color_inc
- as x value goes up by one, increment color my color_inc

optimized
- increment bucket by drop
- if bucket >= level, increase color by one, adjust level by level
- drop = color_diff / x_diff * 1000
- level = 1 * 1000

/*
- feed the color ft x or y coords depending on the slope of the line
- z difference / point difference = z incrementer

z incrementer is the amount you must increment z by every time that the point is increased by one
but what about color ? when do you increment color?
you increment it when z goes over the THRESHOLD
the threshold is the color difference / the x difference
wait, so why do I even need to increment z?
